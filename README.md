# Project Title
Dreamers Dance Studio
# Motivation
This is a project for Bivens Blueprint, LLC. built using the Next.js framework. The intent of this project is to showcase a simple business website and standard features. It is modeled after a Dance and Model studio. All images are template photos found online and belong to their respective owners. The information is also sampled meant as logical placeholders. The code here is a little cleaner opposed to earlier projects. As I am learning more and getting more comfortable with coding, I am implementing those best practices with new projects.
